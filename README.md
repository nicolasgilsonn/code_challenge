# Code Challenge Readme

Welcome to the code challenge for the recruiting process! This challenge consists of creating a Habit CRUD API using Python and Flask, and a Flutter app to consume the API and provide basic functionality for managing habits.

## Task Description

Your task is to create a Habit CRUD API with Python using the Flask framework. The API should provide endpoints to perform the following operations:

## List all habits
- Create a new habit
- Update an existing habit
- Delete a habit


Additionally, you have the option to choose between creating a Flutter app or a web app using React to consume the CRUD API. The chosen client should have the following functionality:

- For Flutter (mobile): Display a list of habits retrieved from the API, provide a page to create a new habit, allow the user to delete a habit, and allow the user to update an existing habit.

- For React (web app): Display a list of habits retrieved from the API, provide a form to create a new habit, allow the user to delete a habit, and allow the user to update an existing habit.


## Getting Started

To start the code challenge, please follow the steps below:

1. Fork this repository: [repository-link]
2. Clone the forked repository to your local development environment.
3. Create a new branch for your code challenge implementation.
4. Set up the Python environment and install the necessary dependencies for the Flask API.
5. Implement the Habit CRUD API using Flask.
6. Set up the Flutter development environment and create a new Flutter project.
7. Build the Flutter app and create the necessary pages and functionality to consume the API.
8. Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements.
9. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
10. Open a Pull Request to submit your code for review.

## Submission Guidelines

To submit your code challenge, please follow these guidelines:

1. Ensure that your code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices.
2. Include a clear README.md file in your forked repository that provides instructions on how to run and test your code.
3. Make sure to include the necessary configuration files, dependencies, and any other files required to run your code.
4. Double-check that your code is free from any sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or personal data.
5. Open a Pull Request from your branch to the main branch of the original repository.
6. Include a brief description of your implementation in the Pull Request description.
7. Wait for the code review and provide any additional information or clarifications requested.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your code challenge submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Functionality: Does your code meet the requirements and provide the expected functionality?
2. Code Quality: Is your code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
3. Best Practices: Does your code follow best practices and adhere to coding standards?
4. Testing: Have you included tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of your code?
5. Documentation: Is your code accompanied by clear instructions on how to run and test it?
6. Git Workflow: Did you follow the recommended Git workflow by creating branches and submitting a Pull Request?

Please note that after the initial evaluation, our team may schedule a follow-up call with you to discuss your code, implementation choices, and any additional questions we may have. This call is an opportunity for you to showcase your understanding of the challenge and explain your decisions.

We appreciate your effort and look forward to reviewing your submission!
